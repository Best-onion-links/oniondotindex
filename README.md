Awesome Onion Links

ABOUT
Welcome to oniondotindex.com. We are a Tor network dark web directory listing created in order to monitor and study popular darknet marketplaces.

OnionDotIndex.com is being operated by darknet journalists and researchers going by the pseudonym “OnionDotIndex“.

We aim to provide up-to-date, live index of the most popular dark web services, and be transparent and neutral about it. We hope that this project will grow into something much bigger and that will serve the global darknet community. We will try to keep this website alive and updated as much as we can.

How it works?

New websites and services are discovered by traversing the general dark net forum communities or by user submitted contributions via our About (contact) page.

Websites are posted in random category and users can vote for their favorite darknet website and by doing it they can signalize for other users that the site is popular and safe to use. All websites posted on this website are trusted and verified by general darknet community.

As soon as there is any scam alert or some other sort of warning we will remove the website from this directory and disable the redirect. By using our directory you can access darknet markets in a safe and easy way.
